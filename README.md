# JumpStart_Desktop_Application
an application that jumpstarts the day, launching frequently used apps or files at one click

- Project is inspired by the need to always start up the same number of applications and navigating through files at the start of the business day in a previous work experience as a L2 Technical Support Engineer.
- Jumpstart is a single application that starts up a business day quicker, by launching all assigned frequently used apps and files saved in memory, at a single click saving the time through manual navigations.
